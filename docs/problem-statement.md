# Problem Statement: Planet Path

## The Climate Literacy Gap in Africa

Africa faces a critical climate literacy gap that threatens its ability to adapt to and mitigate climate change impacts. While the continent contributes less than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions, it bears disproportionate vulnerability to climate-related disasters, food insecurity, and economic disruption. Despite this urgency, climate education remains fragmented, inaccessible, and disconnected from actionable solutions. Traditional educational systems lack practical, localized climate content, and existing online platforms are often too expensive, require constant internet connectivity, or fail to connect learning to verified community impact projects.

## Target Users

Planet Path serves diverse learners across Africa: **youth aged 18-35** seeking green skills and climate careers; **community groups and environmental clubs** organizing local action; **beginners** with limited climate knowledge but high motivation; **NGOs and community-based organizations** needing training for their teams; and **aspiring climate entrepreneurs** seeking micro-grant opportunities. These users share a common need: accessible, practical climate education that leads to measurable environmental impact and economic opportunity.

## Pain Points

Current climate education solutions fail to address critical barriers: **lack of engaging, localized content** that resonates with African contexts; **no verified community projects** where learners can apply skills; **absence of incentives** like badges, certificates, or micro-grants; **digital divide challenges** including expensive data and unreliable connectivity; and **lack of affordable learning** options that integrate with local payment systems. Learners struggle to find pathways from education to action, and from action to economic opportunity.

## Market Opportunity

The climate action economy is rapidly expanding across Africa. **Climate jobs** in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and conservation are growing at 8% annually. **Carbon markets** and nature-based solutions offer new revenue streams for communities. **Green skills training** is becoming essential for employability. Planet Path positions learners to access these opportunities through verified skill-building, project participation, and direct linkages to climate job boards and micro-grant programs.

## How Planet Path Solves the Problem

Planet Path bridges the climate literacy gap through an integrated platform combining **interactive courses** with **verified micro-projects** that produce measurable environmental outcomes. Learners earn **badges and certificates** for completed courses and project participation, creating a portfolio of climate action credentials. The platform connects users to **job opportunities** and **micro-grant programs**, with **M-PESA/IntaSend payment integration** making learning affordable through mobile money. As a **Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline support**, Planet Path overcomes connectivity barriers, enabling learning in low-bandwidth environments. By aligning with SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 4 (Quality Education), and SDG 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth), Planet Path creates a complete pathway from climate awareness to verified impact to economic opportunity.

## Pilot KPIs (First 90 Days)

### KPI 1: User Activation Metric
**Target**: 70% of registered users complete at least one course module within 30 days of registration.

**Measurement**: Track the percentage of users who progress beyond the first lesson of their first enrolled course. This indicates successful onboarding and initial engagement with the platform's core learning experience.

### KPI 2: Engagement Metric
**Target**: Average of 3.5 course completions per active user and 60% of course completers enroll in at least one verified community project.

**Measurement**: Monitor course completion rates and project enrollment conversion. This demonstrates sustained engagement and the platform's ability to transition learners from education to action.

### KPI 3: Impact Metric
**Target**: 50 verified community projects completed with measurable environmental outcomes (e.g., trees planted, waste diverted, carbon emissions reduced), tracked through project verification system.

**Measurement**: Aggregate environmental impact data from completed projects, verified through photo evidence, community validation, and quantitative metrics. This validates the platform's core value proposition of connecting learning to real-world climate action.
