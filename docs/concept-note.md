# Planet Path: Concept Note

## The Problem

Climate action in Africa faces a critical disconnect: millions of motivated learners lack pathways from education to verified impact. Traditional e-learning platforms deliver knowledge but fail to connect learning to real-world environmental outcomes. Meanwhile, community climate projects struggle to find skilled participants, and learners cannot prove their impact to employers or grant providers. This gap prevents Africa from fully mobilizing its youth—the continent's largest demographic—for climate action, despite growing demand for green skills and carbon market opportunities.

## AI-Enhanced Solution

Planet Path bridges the learning-to-action gap through an integrated platform combining interactive climate courses with verified community micro-projects. Our **AI-powered impact verification assistant** automatically validates project outcomes through photo analysis, community validation, and quantitative metrics, creating trusted records of environmental impact. **Personalized learning paths** adapt to each learner's goals—whether seeking climate careers, community leadership, or entrepreneurial opportunities—delivering relevant content and project recommendations. Learners earn **blockchain-verified badges and certificates** that demonstrate both knowledge and proven impact, creating portable credentials recognized by employers, grant providers, and carbon market platforms.

The platform operates as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline support, overcoming Africa's connectivity challenges. Mobile-first design and M-PESA/IntaSend payment integration ensure accessibility across diverse socioeconomic contexts.

## Monetization Strategy

Planet Path employs a **freemium model** with three revenue streams. Free users access basic courses and can participate in one verified project per month. Premium subscriptions (KES 500/month via IntaSend) unlock unlimited courses, priority project access, advanced certificates, and job board features. **Enterprise partnerships** with NGOs, corporations, and government agencies provide bulk training licenses and white-label solutions for climate education programs, targeting organizations seeking to upskill teams or communities. Additionally, **project verification fees** (KES 200 per verified project completion) create a sustainable model where impact generates revenue, aligning platform incentives with environmental outcomes.

## Go-to-Market Pilot Plan

Our 90-day pilot launches in Kenya, targeting Nairobi and surrounding counties with high youth unemployment and active environmental movements. Phase 1 (Days 1-30): Partner with 5 environmental NGOs to onboard 20 verified community projects (tree planting, waste management, renewable energy installations). Recruit 500 beta learners through university partnerships, environmental clubs, and social media campaigns. Phase 2 (Days 31-60): Launch 10 foundational courses covering climate science, sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, and conservation. Activate AI verification system and badge issuance. Phase 3 (Days 61-90): Introduce premium tier, establish partnerships with 3 green job boards, and launch micro-grant application system. Target: 70% user activation, 3.5 course completions per active user, and 50 verified project completions with measurable environmental outcomes.

## Target Users

**Primary**: Youth aged 18-35 seeking green skills and climate careers, representing Africa's largest and most digitally-native demographic. **Secondary**: Community groups and environmental clubs organizing local action, requiring training and verification tools. **Tertiary**: NGOs and educators needing scalable climate education solutions for their programs. **Enterprise**: Corporations and government agencies seeking to train teams in climate action and sustainability practices.

## Success Metrics (KPIs)

**User Growth**: 1,000 registered users within 90 days; 70% activation rate (users completing at least one course module). **Engagement**: Average 3.5 course completions per active user; 60% of course completers enroll in verified projects. **Impact**: 50 verified community projects completed with measurable outcomes (trees planted, waste diverted, carbon emissions reduced). **Revenue**: 15% premium conversion rate; 3 enterprise partnerships signed. **Retention**: 40% monthly active user rate; average session duration of 25 minutes.
